# NBAR - Node-Based Analog Renderer
---
1. **What is NBAR?**
   - NBAR is a tool for making realistic analog footage [VHS, glitchart, etc.].
2. **How does it work?**
   - NBAR works by doing the following: it converts digital video to analog, applies effects [contrast boost, noise, etc.] to the video with nodes you can change and swap, then converts it back.
3. **Why does NBAR exist?**
   - NBAR exists to remove fake VHS filters that don't look good and aren't accurate off the internet. NBAR is also free and open source to make additional changes easy, and so you don't have to buy a real VCR.
4. **Can I add my own nodes?**
   - Yes. By duplicating an already existing node in nodedb.lua and changing the properties and functionality, you can add any custom node you want!
